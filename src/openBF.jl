# __openBF__ is a computational library written
# in [Julia](julialang.org) for blood flow simulations
# in straight elastic arteries. Navier-Stokes equations are reduced
# to 1D form and solved along the longitudinal direction. Numerical
# solution is achieved via a first-order finite volume solver
# based on the Godunov' method. For an usage example refer to
# [main.jl](main.html) file and its documentation.
module openBF

# ### Import openBF' files

# OpenBF' own types are contained in [BTypes.jl](BTypes.html) where
# data structures for vessels, blood, and numerical scheme
# are specified.

# Data structures and output files are initialised at the beginning
# of each simulation. [initialise.jl](initialise.html) contains all
# the functions needed to read model description and the
# global settings.
include("initialise.jl")

# Inlet and outlets boundary conditions are applied at each time step,
# and vessels extremity nodes are updated with functions defined in
# [boundary_conditions.jl](boundary_conditions.html).
include("boundary_conditions.jl")

# Interface problems (junctions and bifurcations) are solved via the
# method of characteristics. The function in
# [junctions.jl](junctions.html) discriminates between
# [conjunctions](conjunctions.html) and
# [bifurcations](bifurcations.jl), and calls the appropriate solver.

# [godunov.jl](godunov.html) contains Godunov' method functions.

# [MUSCL.jl](MUSCL.html) is where the MUSCL method is implemented.

# Conversions from pressure to cross-sectional area (and vice versa),
# or from cross-sectional area to wave speed (and vice versa) are
# handled by functions in [converter.jl](converter.html); Riemann
# invariants are computed in the same location as well.

# Input and output writing functions are stored defined in

# Convergence check functions are all defined in [check_convergence.jl](check_convergence.html).
